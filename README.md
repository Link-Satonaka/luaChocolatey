#Lua for Windows Chocolatey package

An unnoficial package for Lua for Windows.
See https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/ for what is included.
Currently the package just installs to the default location %programfiles(x86)%\Lua\5.1

An after thought of a versioning scheme for the package is the lua for windows version followed by a package version.
I.e. for 5.1.4.50 the package version would be 5.1.4.5000, 5.1.4.5001 etc.
